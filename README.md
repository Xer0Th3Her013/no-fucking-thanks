# No Fucking Thanks — n‌ft blocker

*Expose N‌FTs for what they really are: shitty JPEGs*

This browser extension replaces occurrences of “N‌FT” with “shitty JPEG”, “Bit‌coin”
with *e.g.* “Buttcoin”, “block‌chain” with “circlejerk”, etc. making the Internet pages
you browse more honest about what they actually talk about.
